[14:33.15]And he coud fix up Algernons amaze to be the same like that one so we could both be doing the same kind.  |  而且他可以调整阿尔吉侬的迷宫，变得和那个一样，这样我们俩就能做同一种了。
[14:40.42]He moved all the bords around on Algernons tabel because they come apart and he could put them together in differnt ways. And then he put the skreen back on top so Algernon woudnt jump over any rows to get to the finish.  |  他把阿尔吉侬桌子上所有的板子都移来移去，因为它们可以拆开，他可以用不同方式把它们拼起来。然后他把网罩放回顶部，这样阿尔吉侬就不会跳过任何线路去到终点。

[15:08.33]He took out his clock and he was trying to hide it.  |  他拿出他的钟，并试图藏起来。
[15:12.31]So I tryed not to look at him and that made me very nervus.  |  所以我尽量不去看他，这让我非常紧张。

[15:25.74]Then I herd Algernon squeeking from the box on the tabel and his feet skratching like he was runing alredy.  |  然后我听到阿尔吉侬在桌子上的箱子里吱吱叫，它的脚抓挠着，好像已经在跑了。

[15:52.54]I was haffway on the bord when I herd Algernon squeek like he was happy again and that means he won the race.  |  当我听到阿尔吉侬又像很开心一样吱吱叫时，我才走到板子的一半，这意味着它赢了比赛。
[16:00.58]And the other ten times we did it over Algernon won evry time because I coudnt find the right rows to get to where it says FINISH.  |  我们重复做了十次，阿尔吉侬每次都赢，因为我找不到正确的路线去到写着“终点”的地方。
[16:09.35]I dint feel bad because I watched Algernon and I lernd how to finish the amaze even if it takes me along time.  |  我没有感觉不好，因为我观察了阿尔吉侬，而且我学会了怎么走出迷宫，即使要花我很长时间。
